# iOS Coding Assignment

This is a coding challenge for iOS developers.  

# Prerequisites
Candidate should have Xcode and Git installed on their machine.

# Step 1
**Fork** this repository on GitHub and **clone** it.

Open the **WeatherPlus** project in Xcode.
 * For the UI, you will use SwiftUI
 * Use the [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel) 
   (MVVM) pattern. Bonus points for also using the Coordinator pattern.

# Step 2

Use the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather
details. Here is an example call requesting the hourly temperature and rainfall
for the lat/long of New York City, NY. Below is an example query you will use. You must
update the latitude and longitude values in the URL to match the listed cities.

`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=40.71&longitude=-74.01&hourly=temperature_2m,rain`

Note: You can use the above query's response to create your data model.

Please use the latitude and longitude of the following cities to fetch
temperature and rainfall conditions for every hour of the day. A day is
considered to run from 00:00:00 through 23:59:59. Hours should be displayed in
the app according to the device's time display option 
(_Settings→General→Date&Time→24-Hour Time_).

| City | Lat  | Long |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| New York | 40.71 | -74.01 |
| Dallas | 32.78 | -96.81 |
| Miami | 25.77 | -80.19 |

Use the images included in the `assets` folder (in the root directory of your
local clone) for a visual indicator of the weather conditions.

| Precipitation | Weather Condition | Image |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 0.0 | Sunny | ![sunny](assets/sunny.png) |
| 0.0 < x < 1.0 | Light Rain | ![light rain](assets/light-rain.png) |
| x >= 1.0 | Heavy Rain | ![heavy rain](assets/heavy-rain.png) |

Here is a rough design for the sample app...

# Expected funtionality in descending order of importance
1. Fetch the current temperature for the three cities and list their current
   temperature, along with a rain or sun symbol as appropriate. 
1. Clicking on a city row will display the full weather report of that city
   for each hour of the day
1. A control at the top of the main screen that switches between 
   Celsius and Fahrenheit. This control can be any type you choose.
1. The temperature system selected in view 1 should be carried to view 2.


# Evaluation
- Clean, readable code
- Knowledge of MVVM, delegation, UI and navigation, fetching and parsing JSON
  data, git.

# Relax
- We're more concerned with your thought process and how you approach the
  problem than the final product.
- Don't worry about the time. We are looking for a working app, not a
  polished one.
